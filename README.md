# NFL-Wide-Receiver-Clustering

#The goal of this project is to analyze the wide receiver position and see the different types of players.

#For example, at the receiver position, there are speed receivers and possession receivers (slower, bigger receivers who are good at 
#catching and blocking). I learned about this 10 years ago so lets see if thats still accurate or if the position has changed.
